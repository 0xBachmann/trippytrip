    Bring your stuff, then sell it before you fly home. People will straight up just offer to buy it from you without you mentioning anything. It's hard to get gear down there.

    You're in luck! Santiago has some great options for climbing and camping gear. Check out stores like Doite, Andesgear, and Patagonia stores. They have a wide selection of equipment, clothing, and accessories for outdoor activities. Also, don't miss the outdoor markets like La Vega Central and La Feria de las Pulgas, where you might find some used or discounted gear. If you're only using the gear for a limited time, consider renting from places like Andesgear or Vertikal. As for bringing gear from Europe, it depends on factors like cost and convenience. Keep in mind the weight, size, and airline restrictions. It might be easier to bring the essentials and rent or buy additional gear locally. Have an amazing trip!
